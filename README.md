# Angular 18 Feature

This repository contains Angular 18 feature demonstrations organized by core concepts. Built and tested using **Visual Studio Code**, this project is ideal for learning and practicing fundamental Angular features including component communication, data binding, directives, forms, routing, and more.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **Components and Communication**  
  Demonstrates parent-child and sibling communication using `@Input()`, `@Output()`, `EventEmitter`, `ng-content`, and shared services.

- **Data Binding**  
  Covers the four forms of data binding in Angular: interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding using `[(ngModel)]`.

- **Forms**  
  Includes examples of both template-driven and reactive forms, along with form validation, custom validators, and form control usage.

- **Pipes, Directives, DI**  
  - Built-in and custom **Pipes** for transforming data.
  - **Directives**: built-in (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, etc.) and custom directives for DOM manipulation.
  - **Dependency Injection** usage with services and providers.

- **Routing**  
  Demonstrates setting up Angular Router, navigation between components, route parameters, child routes, and lazy loading.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
